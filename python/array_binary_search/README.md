# Challenge Summary
- Write a function called **BinarySearch** which:
-  takes in 2 parameters: 
   -  a sorted array and, 
   -  the search key 
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language:
- return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, 
  - Input: [4,8,15,16,23,42], 15
  - Output: 2
- or -1 if the element does not exist.
  - Input: [11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90
  - Output: -1

NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

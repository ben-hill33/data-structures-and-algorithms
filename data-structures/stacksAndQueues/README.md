# Stacks and Queues
Stack is last in first out (LIFO). The top node is the last node and just like a stack of dishes, you wouldn't want pull out a dish from the stack except from the top. Likewise when you add to the stack you will also add to the top. 
A Queue is first in first out (FIFO). Enqueue will add to the queue, Dequeue will remove from the queue.
I'll use javascript's built in array methods.

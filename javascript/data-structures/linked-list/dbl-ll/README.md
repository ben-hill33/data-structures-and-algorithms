# Doubly Linked List

Like my [singly linked list](../more-ll/README.md), this doubly linked list will import a [node class](node.js) with the same methods as the singly linked list. The only difference being the Node will have a previous value and methods to set and get previous nodes.

For now, I want this linked list to:
- add a new node to the head of the list
- add a new node to the end of the list
- remove a node from the head and tail
- find and remove a specific node by value
- print out the list in order from head to tail

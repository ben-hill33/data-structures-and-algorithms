# Linked List

This Linked List's nodes will be required in from my [Node class](../../node-class/README.md). 

## Summary
A linked list is a _linear data structure_ where elements are not stored at contiguous locations like an array. Instead the elements use _pointers_ that link each node together.
- Linked lists store data in nodes, describing the value it holds and the value of the next, or previous, node it's linked to.

For now, I want this linked list to be able to:
- add a new node to the end (tail) of the list
- remove a node from the head
- print out nodes in the list in order from head to tail

## Implementation

Constructor for Linked List class will store a default value of `null`. The following methods will build out the data structure:
### `addToHead()`
- Adds a new node to the beginning of the list starting at the `head` node. 
- If the list is empty, then the value of the head node is `null`.
- If the list is not empty, 

### `addToTail()`
- Adds a new node to the end of the list starting at the `tail` node.

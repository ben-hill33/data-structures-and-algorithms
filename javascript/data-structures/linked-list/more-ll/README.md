# Linked List class

This Linked List's node's will be required from my Node class. 
- [Click here](../../node-class/README.md) to view how it's set up.

For now, I want this linked list to be able to:
- add a new node to the beginning (head) of the list
- add a new node to the end (tail) of the list
- remove a node from the head
- print out nodes in the list in order from head to tail
